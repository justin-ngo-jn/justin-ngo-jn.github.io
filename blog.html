                When I first started looking into this assignment,
                the issue that I had the most challenge with was getting used
                Git and everything about it. It is my first time using Git and repositories,
                so it was hard to get used to. I am still not used to using the commands in the terminal,
                so I decided to use GitHub Desktop for this assignment. I took a HTML and CSS class in my first year,
                so I know the basics of web development, but this assignment was a good refresher and it was also fun.
                From this assignment, I got comfortable with the structure and format of HTML. I also learned how to resize my image
                in HTML because the original size was too big.
