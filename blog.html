                When I first started looking into this assignment,
                the issue that I had the most challenge with was getting used
                Git and everything about it. It is my first time using Git and repositories,
                so it was hard to get used to. I am still not used to using the commands in the terminal,
                so I decided to use GitHub Desktop for this assignment. I took a HTML and CSS class in my first year,
                so I know the basics of web development, but this assignment was a good refresher and it was also fun.
                From this assignment, I got comfortable with the structure and format of HTML. I also learned how to resize my image
                in HTML because the original size was too big.

                For the past two to three weeks, I've been sick with the flu and could not attend any of my classes. For this class, 
                I attended the Zoom meetings for the lectures. Some things that were challenging about this assignment was that it was a lot of trial and error.
                I also looked up a lot of things I did not understand in CSS, but they were helpful to learn. After a couple tries, I would eventually solve the problems that I had.
                Another challenge was getting the correct paddings and margins. The concept is still a bit weird to me but I tried my best to make the website look like the mock.
                I learned a lot about formatting the page and the multiple CSS properties that were helpful. A resource that I used a lot for this assignment was 
                www.w3schools.com. The website helped me refresh my memory on simple concepts as well as new ones that I did not know for this assignment. 
                I had to Google how to use the property Flex again as well as how to make a proper box shadow for the add button.
