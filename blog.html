                When I first started looking into this assignment,
                the issue that I had the most challenge with was getting used
                Git and everything about it. It is my first time using Git and repositories,
                so it was hard to get used to. I am still not used to using the commands in the terminal,
                so I decided to use GitHub Desktop for this assignment. I took a HTML and CSS class in my first year,
                so I know the basics of web development, but this assignment was a good refresher and it was also fun.
                From this assignment, I got comfortable with the structure and format of HTML. I also learned how to resize my image
                in HTML because the original size was too big.

                For the past two to three weeks, I've been sick with the flu and could not attend any of my classes. For this class, 
                I attended the Zoom meetings for the lectures. Some things that were challenging about this assignment was that it was a lot of trial and error.
                I also looked up a lot of things I did not understand in CSS, but they were helpful to learn. After a couple tries, I would eventually solve the problems that I had.
                Another challenge was getting the correct paddings and margins. The concept is still a bit weird to me but I tried my best to make the website look like the mock.
                I learned a lot about formatting the page and the multiple CSS properties that were helpful. A resource that I used a lot for this assignment was 
                www.w3schools.com. The website helped me refresh my memory on simple concepts as well as new ones that I did not know for this assignment. 
                I had to Google how to use the property Flex again as well as how to make a proper box shadow for the add button.

                For this assignment, I could not finish the filtering portion of the assignment in time. I had to return to Portland for my mother's birthday and things to do while I was there and thought that I
                had enough time to understand the assignment and finish it in time. I was stumped on how to begin and structure the filtering conditions and struggled to get any
                momentum. My plan was was to implement if statements such as if i >= min_input, show posts >= min_input. The first part of the assignment for me was easy to understand
                once I understood how to get the values of the input and able to implement them. My code is a bit redundant but it is able to do its job. I could simplify my code using
                functions such as turning the text boxs into empty string. I Google'd how to show hidden elements with buttons or using clicks and went with the function route, changing
                the CSS display from hidden to block instead of using toggle.

                For this assignment, I was struggling with how to read in multiple files. I was able to read in the html file but displayed no styling or javascript. I also did not understand how to
                read the 404 html file as the error argument when reading in the index html file. Everything clicked when I decided to use if else statements for reading in files. I could've used switch statements
                if I wanted to simplify my code but the way I wrote it is easier for me to understand. Understanding the style and path for the URLs was a bit tricky for me, especially with the "/" and "." in the directory.
                At the time I am writing this, I have not figured out how to read the file once when creating the server. I understand that I need to read the files into a variable but I do not know how to format it.
